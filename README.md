# All Stocks Analysis

##Overview
**What we have here is a file, with a click of a button, can analyze the entire dataset. However, it could only go through a dozen of the stock markets data. 
**So a refactor was done to expand the dataset to include the thousands of stocks, and a more effecient search.

##Performance Review
**After refracturing the code I was able to comb through all the data and have an efficent chart that summerized the important information.
The first file below shows the file before being refractored and the second file is after.

##Summary

###Pros and Cons
***The advantages of refractoring in this case was I was able to gather more information than before. We are able to have all the information summerize effecently.
    The disadvantages would be the errors yo may come across. When changing or adding coding, things can get disorganized. I found that even though the coding was correct, 
    the program did not want to run. when I just started from scratch again and put in the same info I did before, it run fine.
